# 🧑‍🏫 Academic Schedule & Analytics Platform – Built with React, Hono, tRPC, and Drizzle ORM

A full-stack academic scheduling and analytics platform with inline editable tables, permission-based access control, and role-aware tracking—powered by a modern TypeScript stack: React, TanStack Router, Hono, tRPC, and Drizzle ORM.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This project is a real-world, production-ready education management platform featuring:

- End-to-end typesafe communication via tRPC  
- Fine-grained permission control (PBAC)  
- Inline class history editing and creation  
- Date- and role-based filters for tracking  
- Fully responsive, component-driven UI  
- Scheduled cron jobs for weekly analytics  
- Optimized developer experience with Bun, Biome, and modular structure

Ideal for schools, universities, or teams building robust, role-aware class scheduling and tracking tools.

## 💡 Tech Highlights

- 🔄 Typesafe data flow across frontend and backend using tRPC + TypeScript  
- 🧑‍🏫 Permission-Based Access Control (PBAC) – scoped actions by role  
- ✏️ Inline editing of schedule entries via double-click  
- 📅 Slot × Date Matrix – intuitive view of classes and gaps  
- 📊 Class history analytics – track per teacher, section, or room  
- 📨 Email verification & password reset via Resend  
- ⚡ Blazing-fast dev environment with Bun and SQLite

## 🔧 Tech Stack

### 🧱 Frontend

- **React** – Component-driven, declarative UI  
- **TypeScript** – Static typing across the stack  
- **TanStack Router** – Nested, type-safe routing  
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework  
- **shadcn/ui** – Accessible components with Radix UI  
- **TanStack Query** – Data synchronization with caching  
- **Redux** – Global state management for auth/user state  

### 🛠 Backend & Infrastructure

- **Hono** – Ultra-light, edge-compatible backend framework  
- **tRPC** – Typesafe APIs without REST or GraphQL  
- **Drizzle ORM** – SQL-first, type-safe database access  
- **SQLite / Turso** – Lightweight, local and edge-friendly database  
- **Bun** – Fast JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with native TS support  

### 🔐 Authentication & Access Control

- **Better Auth** – Email/password login, passkey, verification, reset  
- **PBAC** – Permission-based access rules by role and ownership  
- **Resend** – SMTP email delivery for auth workflows  
- **Middleware-based Guarding** – Centralized route protection  
- **Role-Based UI Logic** – UI adjusts to SuperAdmin, Teacher, CR, etc.  

---

## 📊 Functionality

- 🔍 **Date-Range Filtering** – Select and filter class history over time  
- ✏️ **Inline Table Editing** – Create/edit class info directly in table view  
- 🧩 **Slot × Date Matrix** – Visually map classes in a clean grid  
- 🧠 **Teacher / Section / Room Analytics** – Filter data by overview  
- 🕐 **Weekly Cron Jobs** – Background processing with `Croner`  
- 🧼 **Zero-Runtime Type Errors** – Through TRPC + TypeScript contracts  

---

## 🧪 Developer Experience

- **Biome** – Built-in linting, formatting, and TypeScript fixing  
- **Husky** – Git hooks to ensure clean code before commits  
- **Modular tRPC Routers** – Logical separation by feature/domain  
- **Shared Utilities and Hooks** – Reusable, composable logic across app  
- **Environment Config** – `.env` based per-app dev/prod setups

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### Database setup
This project uses SQLite (Turso) with Drizzle ORM.

1. Start the local SQLite database:

```bash
cd apps/server && bun db:local
```

2. Update your `.env` file in the `apps/server` directory with the appropriate connection details. (see `.env.example` for reference).

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun db:generate
bun db:push
```

### SMTP setup
Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and update SMTP credentials in your `.env` file (see `.env.example` for reference).

### Run the development server
Go to root directory and run: 
```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.

The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in both **apps/server** and **apps/web** before starting the app. Follow `.env.example` files for both `/server` & `/web` folders.


> **Note:** If you specify `VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, you need to explicitly load the `.env` file when running the development server:
>
> ```bash
> bun --env-file=apps/web/.env dev
> ```

### Generating a secure `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`

Generate a cryptographically‑secure secret with **OpenSSL**:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Copy the output and paste it into the `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` entry in your backend `.env` file.

> **Tip:** Regenerate the secret when deploying to a different environment (staging, production, etc.) to isolate sessions across environments.


When deploying to a remote server, update the environment variables accordingly.
