- End-to-end typesafe communication via tRPC  
- Fine-grained permission control (PBAC)  
- Inline class history editing and creation
- Upload, view, and manage files (PDFs, images, etc.) with Supabase Storage
- Date- and role-based filters for tracking  
- Fully responsive, component-driven UI

## 🔧 Tech Stack

### 🧱 Frontend

- **React** – Component-driven, declarative UI  
- **TypeScript** – Static typing across the stack  
- **TanStack Router** – Nested, type-safe routing  
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework  
- **shadcn/ui** – Accessible components with Radix UI

- **SQLite / Turso** – Lightweight, local and edge-friendly database  
- **Supabase Storage** – Secure, signed file uploads per user and course
- **Bun** – Fast JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with native TS support  

### 🔐 Authentication & Access Control

- **Better Auth** – Email/password login, passkey, verification, reset  
- **PBAC** – Permission-based access rules by role and ownership  
- **Resend** – SMTP email delivery for auth workflows  
- **Middleware-based Guarding** – Centralized route protection  
- **Role-Based UI Logic** – UI adjusts to SuperAdmin, Teacher, CR, etc.

## 📊 Functionality

- 🔍 **Date-Range Filtering** – Select and filter class history over time  
- ✏️ **Inline Table Editing** – Create/edit class info directly in table view  
- 🧩 **Slot × Date Matrix** – Visually map classes in a clean grid  
- 🧠 **Teacher / Section / Room Analytics** – Filter data by overview  
- 🕐 **Weekly Cron Jobs** – Background processing with `Croner`  
- 🧼 **Zero-Runtime Type Errors** – Through TRPC + TypeScript contracts  
- 🗃️ **Resource Uploads** – Upload PDFs or images scoped to a course

## 🧪 Developer Experience

- **Biome** – Built-in linting, formatting, and TypeScript fixing  
- **Modular tRPC Routers** – Logical separation by feature/domain  
- **Shared Utilities and Hooks** – Reusable, composable logic across app  
- **Environment Config** – `.env` based per-app dev/prod setups  
- **TurboRepo** – Efficient monorepo task running for scalable project workflows  
- **Lint-Staged + Husky** – Git pre-commit hooks to auto-format staged files with Biome

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### Database setup
This project uses SQLite (Turso) with Drizzle ORM.

1. Start the local SQLite database:

```bash
cd apps/server && bun db:local
```

2. Update your `.env` file in the `apps/server` directory with the appropriate connection details. (see `.env.example` for reference).

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun db:generate
bun db:push
```
4. Populate `role`, `role_permission` & `permission` tables with the JSON's inside `/apps/server/src/db/important-data` folder. 

5. Assign `SuperAdmin` role to the user you want to make SuperAdmin in `user_role` table. And update that user's roleId in `user` Table to `SuperAdmin`.

6. Read the API_PERMISSION Doc `/apps/server/src/routers/API_PERMISSION_REQUIREMENTS.md` for understanding the permissions.

### SMTP setup
Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and update SMTP credentials in your `.env` file (see `.env.example` for reference).

### Supabase setup
- Go to Supbase and create a new project.
- Create a new bucket in the storage tab. and name it `pdf`
- Get service role key and upadate `.env` file (see `.env.example` for reference)

### Run the development server
Go to root directory and run: 
```bash
bun dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.

The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in both **apps/server** and **apps/web** before starting the app. Follow `.env.example` files for both `/server` & `/web` folders.


> **Note:** If you specify `VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, you need to explicitly load the `.env` file when running the development server:
>
> ```bash
> bun --env-file=apps/web/.env dev
> ```

### Generating a secure `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`

Generate a cryptographically‑secure secret with **OpenSSL**:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Copy the output and paste it into the `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` entry in your backend `.env` file.

> **Tip:** Regenerate the secret when deploying to a different environment (staging, production, etc.) to isolate sessions across environments.


When deploying to a remote server, update the environment variables accordingly.

## 🧰 Monorepo Structure
